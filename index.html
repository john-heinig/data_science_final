			<p>The genesis of this project was the biographical dataset that i found on retrosheet.com, in this .csv file there was the biographical data for every professional baseball player to ever play in the major leagues and along with stuff like birthdays and age and etc sections one might expect to find in a list of biographical data there was also a column that listed the known cemetery for each of the players who have passed, and with such data the question was raised about which cemetery in america has the best baseball team buried within it.</p>
